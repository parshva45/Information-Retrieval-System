computer generation of gamma random variables a new method for generating random variables from the gamma distribution with nonintegral shape parameter a is proposed this method is similar to two other methods recently given by wallace and fishman it is compared with fishman s and ahrens and dieter s methods the core storage requirements and programming effort for this method are similar to those of fishman s method the proposed method is the same as fishman s method for 1 a 2 and is faster than fishman s method for 3 a 19 also the proposed method is much simpler than ahrens and dieter s method and is faster for a 8 cacm may 1978 tadikamalla p gamma variables rejection method computer methods 5.5 8.1 ca780509 dh february 26 1979 1:10 pm
