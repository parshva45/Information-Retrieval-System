pm a system for polynomial manipulation pm is an ibm 7094 program system for formal manipulation of polynomials in any number of variables with integral coefficients unrestricted in size some of the formal operations which can be performed by the system are sums differences products quotients derivatives substitutions and greater common divisors pm is based on the refco iii list processing system which is described and compared with the lisp and slip systems the pm subroutines for arithmetic of large integers are described as constituting an independently useful subsystem pm is compared with the alpak system in several respects including the choice of canonical forms for polynomials a new algorithm for polynomial greatest common divisor calculation is mentioned and exaples are included to illustrate its superiority cacm august 1966 collins g e ca660805 jb march 2 1978 7:51 pm
