on the complexity of lr k testing the problem of determining whether an arbitrary context free grammar is a member of some easily parsed subclass of grammars such as the lr k grammars is considered the time complexity of this problem is analyzed both when k is considered to be a fixed integer and when k is considered to be a parameter of the test in the first case it is shown that for every k there exists an o n k 2 algorithm for testing the lr k property where n is the size of the grammar in question on the other hand if both k and the subject grammar are problem parameters then the complexity of the problem depends very strongly on the representation chosen for k more specifically it is shown that this problem is np complete when k is expressed in unary when k is expressed in binary the problem is complete for nondeterministic exponential time these results carry over to many other parameterized classes of grammars such as the ll k strong ll k slr k lc k and strong lc k grammars cacm december 1975 hunt h b iii szymanski t g ullman j d computational complexity context free grammars parsing lr k grammars np complete problems 4.12 5.23 5.25 ca751205 jb january 5 1978 4:28 pm
