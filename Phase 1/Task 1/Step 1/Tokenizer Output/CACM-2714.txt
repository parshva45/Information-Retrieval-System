merging with parallel processors consider two linearly ordered sets a b a m b n m n and p p m parallel processors working synchronously the paper presents an algorithm for merging a and b with the p parallel processors which requires at most 2 log2 2m 1 3m p m p log2 n m steps if n 2 b m b an integer the algorithm requires at most 2 log2 m 1 m p 2 b steps in the case where m and n are of the same order of magnitude i e n km with k being a constant the algorithm requires 2 log2 m 1 m p 3 k steps these performances compare very favorably with the previous best parallel merging algorithm batcher s algorithm which requires n p m n 2p log2 m steps in the general case and km p k 1 2 m p log2 m in the special case where n km cacm october 1975 gavril f parallel processing parallel merging parallel binary insertion 5.31 ca751005 jb january 6 1978 10:50 am
