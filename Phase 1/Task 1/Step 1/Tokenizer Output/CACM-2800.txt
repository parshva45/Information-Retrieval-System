connections between accuracy and stability properties of linear multistep formulas this paper is concerned with stability and accuracy of families of linear k step formulas depending on parameters with particular emphasis on the numerical solution of stiff ordinary differential equations an upper bound p k is derived for the order of accuracy of a inf stable formulas three criteria are given for a 0 stability it is shown that 1 for p k k arbitrary a inf stability implies certain necessary conditions for a 0 stability and for strict stability meaning that the extraneous roots of p psi satisfy psi 1 2 for p k 2,3,4 and 5 a inf stability for k 5 together with another constraint implies strict stability and 3 for certain one parameter classes of formulas with p k 3,4 and or 5 a inf stability implies a 0 stability cacm january 1975 liniger w stiff equations parametrized linear multistep formulas order of accuracy a 0 stability a inf stability strict stability 5.17 ca750111 jb january 12 1978 9:26 am
