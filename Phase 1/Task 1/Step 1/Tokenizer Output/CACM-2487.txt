cubic spline solutions to fourth order boundary value problems the cubic spline approximation to the fourth order differential equation y p x y q x y r x y t x is shown to reduce to the solution of a five term recurrence relationship for some special cases the approximation is shown to be simply related to a finite difference representation with a local truncation error of order y 720 delta 8 cacm june 1973 hoskins w d cubic spline differential equations boundary value problem 5.13 5.17 ca730613 jb january 23 1978 1:44 pm
