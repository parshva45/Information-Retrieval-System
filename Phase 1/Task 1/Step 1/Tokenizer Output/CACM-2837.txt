new upper bounds for selection the worst case minimum number of comparisons complexity vi n of the i th selection problem is considered a new upper bound for vi n improves the bound given by the standard hadian sobel algorithm by a generalization of the kirkpatrick hadian sobel algorithm and extends kirkpatrick s method to a much wider range of application this generalization compares favorably with a recent algorithm by hyafil cacm september 1976 yap c k selection problem algorithms comparison problems concrete computational complexity upper bounds worst case analysis 5.25 5.31 ca760902 jb january 4 1978 9:48 am
