is sometim sometim better than alwai intermitt assert in prove
program correct thi paper explor a techniqu for prove the

assert method involv document the program with assert that must
be true at some time when control pass through the

the method introduc by burstal promis to provid a valuabl
complement to the more convent method the intermitt assert method
is present with a number of exampl of correct and
termin proof some of these proof ar markedli simpler than
their convent counterpart on the other hand it is shown
that a proof of correct or termin by ani of
the convent techniqu can be rephras directli as a proof
