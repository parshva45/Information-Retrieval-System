a process for the determin of address in variabl length
address an algorithm is present for the assign of instruct
address and format under the follow condit 1 the length
of the instruct vari as a function of the distanc
of the instruct from it target 2 there exist an
optim criterion which impli some preferenti choic subject to the
address constraint thi mai be for exampl achiev the smallest
number of long instruct in which case the total code
length is minim or minim the assign address of a
specifi point in the program the algorithm is suitabl for
arbitrari program structur and a choic of optim criteria cacm
