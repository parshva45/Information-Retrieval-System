an algorithm for plan collis free path among polyhedr obstacl
thi paper describ a collis avoid algorithm for plan a
safe path for a polyhedr object move among known polyhedr
object the algorithm transform the obstacl so that thei repres
the locu of forbidden posit for an arbitrari refer point
on the move object a trajectori of thi refer point
which avoid all forbidden region is free of collis trajectori
ar found by search a network which indic for each
vertex in the transform obstacl which other vertic can be
