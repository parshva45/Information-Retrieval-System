descriptran autom descript geometri descript geometri consist of procedur origin
design to solv 3 space geometri problem by graphic construct
and measur instead of by comput howev in addit to
thi it unifi and simplifi the approach to mani such
problem when on can call subroutin that comput new coordin
that correspond to those obtain from the graphic construct there
is the three wai advantag of the approach of descript
geometri the accuraci of comput and the speed of the
digit comput descriptran make it possibl to program mani problem
in 3 space with a few statement it consist of
15 subroutin analog to the procedur of descript geometri cacm
