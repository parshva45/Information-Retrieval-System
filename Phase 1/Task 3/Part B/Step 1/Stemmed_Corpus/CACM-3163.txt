an optim insert algorithm for on side height balanc binari
search tree an algorithm for insert an element into a
on side height balanc oshb binari search tree is present
the algorithm oper in time o log n where n
is the number of node in the tree thi repres
an improv over the best previou ly known insert algorithm
of hirschberg and kosaraju which requir time o log 2n
moreov the o log n complex is optim earlier result
have shown that delet in such a structur can also
be perform in o log n time thu the result
of thi paper give a neg answer to the question
of whether such tree should be the first exampl of
their kind where delet ha a smaller time complex than
insert furthermor it can now be conclud that insert delet
and retriev in oshb tree can be perform in the
same time as the correspond oper for the more gener
avl tree to within a constant factor howev the insert
and delet algorithm for oshb tree appear much more complic
than the correspond algorithm for avl tree cacm septemb 1979
