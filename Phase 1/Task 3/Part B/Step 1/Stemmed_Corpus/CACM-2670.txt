effici implement of a variabl project algorithm for nonlinear least
squar problem nonlinear least squar frequent aris for which the
variabl to be solv for can be separ into a
linear and a nonlinear part a variabl project algorithm ha
been develop recent which is design to take advantag of
the structur of a problem whose variabl separ in thi
wai thi paper give a slightli more effici and slightli
more gener version of thi algorithm than ha appear earlier
