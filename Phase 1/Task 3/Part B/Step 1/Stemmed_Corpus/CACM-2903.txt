of program transform call recurs in troduct is describ and
appli to two algorithm which solv pattern match problem by
us recurs in troduct algorithm which manipul a stack ar
first translat into recurs algorithm in which no stack oper
occur these algorithm ar then subject to a second transform
a method of recurs elimin call tabul to produc program

shown how the fast linear pattern match algorithm of knuth
