matrix reduct an effici method the paper describ an effici
method for reduct of the binari matric which aris in
some school time tabl problem it is a develop of
that describ by john lion it ha been gener and
adapt to fit into the complet timet process to us
a more compact data represent and more effici process techniqu
to take fuller advantag of possibl avail previou knowledg about
the matrix and it is design as a structur program
which can readili be code by the reader in the
high level or low level program languag of hi choic
practic test of the method have shown it to be
a good basi for a realist timet algorithm cacm march
