subgoal induct a proof method subgoal induct is present as
an altern or supplement to the commonli us induct assert
method it major virtu is that it can often be
us to prove a loop s correct directli from it
input output specif without the us of an invari the
relat between subgoal induct and other commonli us induct rule
is explor and in particular it is shown that subgoal
induct can be view as a special form of comput
