an applic of heurist search method to edg and contour
detect thi paper present a method for detect edg and
contour in noisi pictur the properti of an edg ar
embed in a figur of merit and the edg detect
problem becom the problem of minim the given figur of
merit thi problem can be repres as a shortest path
problem on a graph and can be solv us well
known graph search algorithm the relat between thi represent of
the minim problem and a dynam program approach ar discuss
show that the graph search method can lead to substanti
improv in comput time moreov if heurist search method ar
us the comput time will depend on the amount of
nois in the pictur some experiment result ar given these
show how variou inform about the shape of the contour
of an object can be embed in the figur of
merit thu allow the extract of contour from noisi pictur
and the separ of touch object cacm februari 1976 martelli
