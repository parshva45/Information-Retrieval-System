of research the type of error were identifi in a
pilot studi then us the 132 error type found 1
777 error were classifi in 1 4000 run of 73
cobol student error densiti wa high 20 percent of the
type contain 80 percent of the total frequenc which impli
high potenti effect for softwar base correct of cobol surprisingli
onli four high frequenc error were error prone which impli
minim error induc design 80 percent of cobol misspel were
classifi in the four error categori of previou research which
impli that cobol misspel ar correct by exist algorithm reserv
word usag wa not error prone which impli minim interfer
