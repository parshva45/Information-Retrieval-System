product of multiprogram comput progress in develop an analyt predict
method multiprogram as it is discuss here is a mode
of comput oper in which two or more program ar
concurr in processor memori and proceed each us the same
central processor unit cpu and input output i o channel
these program ar actual proceed intermitt and singli accord to
elig readi to proce and prioriti it is us to
be abl to repres them as proceed continu and simultan
each at an effect rate which mai be a fraction
of that which it would enjoi in the absenc of
the other program the effect progress rate of each program
is sensit to mani detail characterist of itself and it
co resid and simul ha been the best avail method
of predict it thi paper present the result of progress
