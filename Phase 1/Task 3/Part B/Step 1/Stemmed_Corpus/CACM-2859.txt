interfer in multiprocessor comput system with interleav memori thi paper
analyz the memori interfer caus by sever processor simultan us
sever memori modul exect result ar comput for a simpl
model of such a system the limit valu is deriv
for the rel degre of memori interfer as the system
size increas the model of the limit behavior of the
system yield approxim result for the simpl model and also
suggest that the result ar valid for a much larger
class of model includ those more nearli like real system
that the simpl model ar test against some measur of
program behavior and simul of system us memori refer from
real program the model result provid a good indic of
the perform that should be expect from real system of
