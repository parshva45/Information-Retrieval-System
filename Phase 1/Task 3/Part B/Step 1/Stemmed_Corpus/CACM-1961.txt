an effici search algorithm to find the elementari circuit of
a graph a theoret most effici search algorithm is present
which us an exhaust search to find all of the
elementari circuit of a graph the algorithm can be easili
modifi to find all of the elementari circuit with a
particular attribut such as length a rigor proof of the
algorithm is given as well as an exampl of it
applic empir bound ar present relat the speed of the
algorithm to the number of vertic and the number of
arc the speed is also relat to the number of
circuit in the graph to give a relat between speed
and complex extens to undirect and s graph ar discuss
