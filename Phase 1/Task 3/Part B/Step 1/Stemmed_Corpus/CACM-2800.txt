connect between accuraci and stabil properti of linear multistep formula
thi paper is concern with stabil and accuraci of famili
of linear k step formula depend on paramet with particular
emphasi on the numer solut of stiff ordinari differenti equat
an upper bound p k is deriv for the order
of accuraci of a inf stabl formula three criteria ar
given for a 0 stabil it is shown that 1
