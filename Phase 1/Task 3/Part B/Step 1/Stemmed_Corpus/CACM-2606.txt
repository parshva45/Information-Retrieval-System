a new integr algorithm for ordinari differenti equat base on
continu fraction approxim a new integr algorithm is found and
an implement is compar with other program algorithm the new
algorithm is a step by step procedur for solv the
initi valu problem in ordinari differenti equat it is design
to approxim pole of small integ order in the solut
of the differenti equat by continu fraction obtain by manipul
the sum of truncat taylor seri expans the new method
is compar with gragg bulirsh stoer and the taylor seri
method the taylor seri method and the new method ar
shown to be superior in speed and accuraci while the
new method is shown to be most superior when the
solut is requir near a singular the new method can
final be seen to pass automat through singular where all
the other method which ar discuss will have fail cacm
