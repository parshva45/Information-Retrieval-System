textur and reflect in comput gener imag in 1974 catmul
develop a new algorithm for render imag of bivari surfac
patch thi paper describ extens of thi algorithm in the
area of textur simul and light model the parameter of
a patch defin a coordin system which is us as
a kei for map pattern onto the surfac the intens
of the pattern at each pictur element is comput as
a weight averag of region of the pattern definit function
the shape and size of thi weight function ar chosen
us digit signal process theori the patch render algorithm allow
accur comput of the surfac normal to the patch at
each pictur element permit the simul of the mirror reflect
the amount of light come from a given direct is
model in a similar manner to the textur map and
then ad to the intens obtain from the textur map
