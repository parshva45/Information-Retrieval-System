logic and program languag logic ha been long in terest
in whether answer to certain question ar comput in principl
sinc the outcom put bound on the possibl of formal
more recent precis comparison in the effici of decis method
have becom avail through the develop in complex theori these
howev ar applic to logic and a big question is
whether method of logic have signific in the other direct
for the more appli part of comput theori program languag
offer an obviou opportun as their syntact formal is well
advanc howev the semant theori can hardli be said to
be complet though we have mani exampl we have still
to give wide rang mathemat answer to these queri what
is a machin what is a comput process how or
how well doe a machin simul a process program natur
enter in give descript of process the definit of the
precis mean of a program then requir us to explain
what ar the object of comput in a wai the
static of the problem and how thei ar to be
transform the dynam so far the theori of automata and
of net though most in terest for dynam have formal
onli a portion of the field and there ha been
perhap too much concentr on the finit state and algebra
aspect it would seem that the understand of higher level
program featur involv us with infinit object and forc us
to pass through sever level of explan to go from
the conceptu idea to the final simul on a real
machin these level can be made mathemat exact if we
can find the right abstract to repres the necessari structur
the experi of mani independ worker with the method of
data type as lattic or partial order under an inform
content order and with their continu map ha demonstr the
flexibl of thi approach in provid definit and proof which
ar clean and without undu depend on implement nevertheless much
remain to be done in show how abstract conceptu can
or cannot be actual befor we can sai we have
