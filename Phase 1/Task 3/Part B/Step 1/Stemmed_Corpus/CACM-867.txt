least squar fit of plane to surfac us dynam program
dynam program ha recent been us by stone by bellman
and by gluss to determin the closet fit of broken
line segment to a curv in an interv under the
constraint that the number of segment is fix in the
present paper success model ar develop to extend the method
to the fit of broken plane segment to surfac z
g x y defin over certain type of subarea of
the x y space the first model consid a rectangular
area with the constraint that the plane segment ar defin
over a grid in the x y space it is
then shown how thi model mai be incorpor into an
algorithm that provid success approxim to optim fit for ani
type of close area final applic ar briefli describ cacm
