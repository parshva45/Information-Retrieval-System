interfer detect among solid and surfac in mani industri environ
it is necessari to determin whether r there is interfer
among compon there ar mani potenti interfer problem in product
made up of assembl of compon and in product manufactur
and test typic draw ar us in an attempt to
detect such unwant interfer but the two dimension static draft
medium doe not alwai show interfer among three dimension move
