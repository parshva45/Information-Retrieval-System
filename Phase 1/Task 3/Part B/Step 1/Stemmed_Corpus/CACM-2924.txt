an interact comput graphic approach to surfac represent an in
teract comput graphic method ha been develop for the rapid
gener of arbitrari shape three dimension surfac the method is
a synthesi of spline theori and algorithm an in teract
mean for man machin commun and softwar for static or
dynam graphic displai the basic techniqu emploi is a modifi
loft method on which section curv ar repres by uniform
b spline and the surfac is in terpol between section
by cardin spline among the featur of thi method ar
algorithm which enabl in teract modif of the b spline
represent of the section curv at all stage of the
process the spatial inform is graphic displai to the user
complex surfac can be creat by the combin of a
number of shape that have been separ gener and automat
join the system ha been successfulli in terfac to a
varieti of analyt routin for structur medic and graphic applic
