on the optim of perform of time share system by
simul a simul model of a time share system with
a finit noncontigu store and an infinit auxiliari store is
us to studi the variat of system paramet such as
store size number of job allow to execut simultan job
schedul algorithm etc the effect of these variat on a
measur of system perform is us to ascertain which of
the paramet control by the job schedul algorithm includ the
schedul itself requir optim and which of the paramet not
normal control by the schedul algorithm have a mark effect
on system perform system perform is base upon the mean
cost of delai to all job process it is shown
that signific improv in the measur of system perform can
be obtain by us variabl time slice techniqu and by
select the optimum round robin cycl time it appear that
these featur would benefit from optim wherea other paramet control
by the schedul algorithm affect system perform in a predict
manner and would not benefit from optim featur not normal
under the control of the schedul algorithm can also have
a mark effect on the measur of perform in particular
supervisor overhead the size of the store and the speed
of the cpu a comparison is made between the result
of the simul model and two analyt equat for quantum
orient nonpreempt time share system the comparison is found to
