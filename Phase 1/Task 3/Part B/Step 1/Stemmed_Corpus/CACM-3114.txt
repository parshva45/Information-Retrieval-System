a techniqu for isol differ between file a simpl algorithm
is describ for isol the differ between two file on
applic is the compar of two version of a sourc
program or other file in order to displai all differ
the algorithm isol differ in a wai that correspond close
to our intuit notion of differ is easi to implement
and is computation effici with time linear in the file
length for most applic the algorithm isol differ similar to
those isol by the longest common subsequ anoth applic of
thi algorithm merg file contain independ gener chang into a
singl file the algorithm can also be us to gener
effici encod of a file in the form of the
differ between itself and a given datum file permit reconstruct
of the origin file from the differ and datum file
