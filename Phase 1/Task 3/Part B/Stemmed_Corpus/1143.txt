analysi of decai type data a compar studi ha been
made of a varieti of numer techniqu for fit experiment
data of the decai type by form involv the sum
of exponenti statist error of the fit paramet ar also
calcul these method have been appli to artifici gener set
of data as well as to the result of experi
with radioact tracer on both human and anim subject result
show that the valu of the fit paramet ar veri
sensit to variat in the fit procedur therefor great care
veri sensit to variat in the fit procedur therefor great
care must be exercis in identifi such valu with physic
constant although the valu of function deriv from these fit
paramet which can definit be associ with physic entiti ar
gener more stabl under variat in the fit techniqu error
bound can be so larg that no great confid can
be place even in them it would therefor appear best
to select a uniform techniqu both for run the experi
and for analyz the data and then to consid as
signific onli rel result between on subject and the next
