comput gener of gamma random variat with non integr shape
paramet when the shape paramet a is integr gener gamma
random variabl with a digit comput is straightforward there is
no simpl method for gener gamma random variat with non
integr shape paramet a common procedur is to approxim gener
such random variabl by us of the so call probabl
switch method anoth procedur which is exact is due to
johnk thi paper present a reject method for exactli gener
gamma random variabl when a is greater than 1 the
effici of the reject method is shown to be better
than the effici of johnk s method the paper conclud
that when a is non integr the follow mix of
procedur yield the best combin of accuraci and effici 1
when a is less than 1 us johnk s method
2 when 1 is less than a and a is
less than 5 us the reject method 3 when a
is greater than 5 us the probabl switch method cacm
