a polici driven schedul for a time share system the
servic receiv by a process from a time share oper
system can be character by a resourc count sum w
i r ij where r ij is the number of
unit of servic receiv by process i from resourc i
and w i is the cost per unit of the
servic each class of user can be character by a
polici function which specifi the amount of servic a user
who belong to thi class should receiv as a function
of time prioriti chang dynam as a function of the
differ between the servic promis to the user by the
polici function and the servic he actual receiv a schedul
and swap algorithm which keep the resourc count of each
process abov it polici function will provid the specifi level
of servic overhead can be reduc by avoid swap of
process which have receiv at least hi level of servic
the algorithm ha been implement in a gener purpos oper
system and it ha provid significantli better servic to interact
and to batch job than the previou schedul cacm februari
