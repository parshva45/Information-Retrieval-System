experi in automat learn for a multipurpos heurist program an
automat learn capabl ha been develop and implement for us
with the multipl multipurpos program that learn heurist tree search
program which is present be appli to resolut theorem prove
in predic calculu multipl s prove program pp us two
evalu function to guid it search for a proof of
whether or not a particular goal is achiev thirteen gener
featur of predic calculu claus were creat for us in
the automat learn of better evalu function for pp a
multipl regress program wa us to produc optim coeffici for
linear polynomi function in term of the featur also automat
data handl routin were written for pass data between the
learn program and the prove program and for analyz and
summar result data wa gener collect for learn regress analysi
from the experi of pp a number of experi were
perform to test the effect and gener of the learn
program result show that the learn produc dramat improv in
the solut to problem which were in the same domain
as those us for collect learn data learn wa also
shown to gener successfulli to domain other than those us
for data collect anoth experi demonstr that the learn program
could simultan improv perform on problem in a specif domain
and on problem in a varieti of domain some variat
of the learn program were also test cacm februari 1971
