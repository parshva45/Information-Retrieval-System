comput formul of the equat of motion us tensor notat
a mean is describ for extend the area of applic
of digit comput beyond the numer data process stage and
reduc the need for human particip in the formul of
certain type of comput problem by the us of tensor
calculu and a comput languag design to facilit symbol mathemat
comput a method ha been devis wherebi a digit comput
can be us to do non numer work that is
symbol algebra manipul and differenti to illustr the techniqu involv
a digit comput ha been us to deriv the equat
of motion of a point mass in a gener orthogon
curvilinear coordin system sinc thi oper involv a formul in
term of first and second order differenti coeffici it provid
a good demonstr of a comput s capabl to do
non numer work and to assist in the formul process
which normal preced the numer data process stage moreov thi
particular problem serv to illustr the advantag of the mathemat
techniqu emploi with the program prepar for thi purpos the
comput will deriv the equat of motion in ani coordin
system request by the user result ar present for the
follow coordin system cylindr polar spheric polar and prolat spheroid
