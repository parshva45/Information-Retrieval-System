cellular arrai for the solut of graph problem a cellular
arrai is a two dimension checkerboard type interconnect of ident
modul or cell where each cell contain a few bit
of memori and a small amount of combin logic and
commun mainli with it immedi neighbor in the arrai the
chief comput advantag offer by cellular arrai is the improv
in speed achiev by virtu of the possibl for parallel
process in thi paper it is shown that cellular arrai
ar inher well suit for the solut of mani graph
problem for exampl the adjac matrix of a graph is
easili map onto an arrai each matrix element is store
in on cell of the arrai and typic row and
column oper ar readili implement by simpl cell logic a
major challeng in the effect us of cellular arrai for
the solut of graph problem is the determin of algorithm
that exploit the possibl for parallel especi for problem whose
solut appear to be inher serial in particular sever parallel
algorithm ar present for the solut of certain span tree
distanc and path problem with direct applic to wire rout
pert chart analysi and the analysi of mani type of
network these algorithm exhibit a comput time that in mani
case grow at a rate not exceed log2 n where
n is the number of node in the graph straightforward
cellular implement of the well known serial algorithm for these
problem requir about n step and noncellular implement requir from
n 2 to n 3 step cacm septemb 1972 levitt
