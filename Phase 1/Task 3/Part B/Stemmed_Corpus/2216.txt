on the probabl distribut of the valu of binari tree
an integr equat is deriv for the gener function for
binari tree valu the valu reflect sort effort the analysi
doe not assum uniformli distribut branch ratio and therefor is
applic to a famili of sort algorithm discuss by hoar
singleton and van emden the solut to the integr equat
indic that us more advanc algorithm in the famili make
onli minor reduct in the expect sort effort but substanti
reduc the varianc in sort effort statist test of the
valu of sever thousand tree contain up to 10 000
point have given first second and third moment of the
valu distribut function in satisfactori agreement with the moment comput
from the gener function the empir test as well as
the analyt result ar in agreement with previous publish result
for the first moment in the case of uniform and
nonuniform distribut of branch ratio and for the second moment
in the case of uniform distribut of branch ratio cacm
