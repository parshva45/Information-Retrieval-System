polynomi and spline approxim by quadrat program the problem of
approxim to a given function or of fit a given
set of data where the approxim function is requir to
have certain of it deriv of specifi sign over the
whole rang of approxim is studi two approach ar present
in each of which quadrat program is us to provid
both the constraint on the deriv and the select of
the function which yield the best fit the first is
a modifi bernstein polynomi scheme and the second is a
