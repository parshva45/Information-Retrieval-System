spline function method for nonlinear boundari valu problem the solut
of the nonlinear differenti equat y f x y y
with two point boundari condit is approxim by a quintic
or cubic spline function y x the method is well
suit to nonuniform mesh size and dynam mesh size alloc
for uniform mesh size h the error in the quintic
spline y x is o h 4 with typic error
on third that from numerov s method requir the differenti
equat to be satisfi at the mesh point result in
a set of differ equat which ar block tridiagon and
so ar easili solv by relax or other standard method
