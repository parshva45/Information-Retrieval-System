the augment predict analyz for context free languag it rel
effici it ha been proven by greibach that for a
given context free grammar g a standard form grammar gs
can be construct which gener the same languag as is
gener by g and whose rule ar all of the
form z cy 1 y m m o where z
and y i ar intermedi symbol and c a termin
symbol sinc the predict analyz at harvard us a standard
form grammar it can accept the languag of ani context
free grammar g given an equival standard form grammar gs
the structur descript sd gs x assign to a given
sentenc x by the predict analyz howev ar usual differ
from the structur descript sd g x assign to the
same sentenc by the origin context free grammar g from
which gs is deriv in section 1 an algorithm origin
due to abbott is describ standard form grammar each of
whose rule is in standard form supplement by addit inform

techniqu for perform the sd gs x to sd g
x transform effect is also describ in section 2 the
augment predict analyz as a pars algorithm for arbitrari context
free languag is compar with two other pars algorithm a
select top to bottom algorithm similar to iron error correct
pars algorithm and an immedi constitu analyz which is an
extens of sakai cock s algorithm for normal grammar the
comparison is base upon sever criteria of effici cover core
