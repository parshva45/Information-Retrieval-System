experi with an automat theorem prover havingparti order infer rule
automat theorem prover need to be made much more effici
with thi in mind slagl ha shown how the axiom
for partial order can be replac by built in infer
rule when us a particular theorem prove algorithm base upon
hyper resolut and paramodul the new rule embodi the transit
of partial order and the close relationship between predic a
program ha been develop us a modifi version of these
rule thi new theorem prover ha been found to be
veri power for solv problem involv partial order thi paper
present a detail descript of the program and a comprehens
account of the experi that have been perform with it
