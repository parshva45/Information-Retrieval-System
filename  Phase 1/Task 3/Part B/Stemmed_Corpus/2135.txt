rapid comput of gener interpol formula and mechan quadratur rule
let f have n continu on a close interv a
b and let l be a linear function the attempt
is made to approxim l f with l q where
q is a polynomi approxim f algorithm ar develop for
rapid comput of l q for a wide class of
select of q which includ the lagrangian and hermitian rule
