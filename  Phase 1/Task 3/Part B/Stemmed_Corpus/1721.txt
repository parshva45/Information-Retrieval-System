determin of the intersect point of two plane curv by
mean of differenti equat a new method is propos to
calcul the intersect point of two plane curv the theori
of singular point off a system of two differenti equat
is us in develop the method the intersect point to
be determin is identifi with such a singular point and
appropri modif ar appli to the system to ensur that
the singular point be stabl i e all integr which
start in the neighborhood of the singular point will alwai
approach thi point if the integr paramet tend to infin
in addit a method is describ for systemat search for
all intersect point in a prescrib rectangular area cacm juli
