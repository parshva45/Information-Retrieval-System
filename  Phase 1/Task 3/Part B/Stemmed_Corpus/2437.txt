gener perform analysi of kei to address transform method us
an abstract file concept thi paper present a new approach
to the analysi of perform of the variou kei to
address transform method in thi approach the kei in a
file ar assum to have been select from the kei
space accord to a certain probabilist select algorithm all file
with the same number of kei select from thi kei
space will be suitabl weight in accord with the algorithm
and the averag perform of the transform method on these
file will be us as the potenti of these method
us thi analysi method with the same overal perform can
be classifi and kei distribut partial to certain transform can
be identifi all thi can be done analyt the approach
is appli to a group of transform method us file
