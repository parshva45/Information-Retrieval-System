fen an axiomat basi for program semant a formal system
is present which abstract the notion of data item function
and relat it is argu that the system is more
suitabl than set theori or it deriv for the concis
and accur descript of program semant it is shown how
the system can be us to build composit data type
out of simper on with the oper of row structur
and unit it is also demonstr that complet new primit
type can be introduc into languag through the mechan of
singleton data type both determinist and nondeterminist function ar shown
to be defin in the system it is describ how
the local environ can be model as a data item
and how imper statement can be consid function on the
environ the natur of recurs function is briefli discuss and
a techniqu is present by which thei can be introduc
into the system the techniqu is contrast with the us
of the paradox combin y the question of local and
global environ and of variou mode of function call and
paramet pass ar touch upon the theori is appli to
the proof of sever elementari theorem concern the semant of
the assign condit and iter statement an appendix is includ
which present in detail the formal system govern web and
