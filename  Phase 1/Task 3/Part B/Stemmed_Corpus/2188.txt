an approach to the optimum design of comput graphic system
displai system design ar face with the difficult task of
select major subsystem in an intellig wai each subsystem is
chosen from larg number of altern the select is base
on consider such as system respons time system cost and
the distribut of data storag and process between the graphic
processor and it support data process system the work report
here develop an object quantit design procedur and help give
a better understand of now to configur displai system thi
is accomplish by mean of a mathemat model of a
comput driven graphic system the paramet of the model ar
function of the capabl of the graphic hardwar and of
the comput requir of the graphic applic the model can
be analyz us numer queue analysi or simul to obtain
an averag respons time predict by combin the model with
an optim the best graphic system configur subject to a
cost constraint is found for sever applic the optimum configur
ar in turn us to find gener displai system design
