trace driven model and analysi of cpu schedul in multiprogram
system microscop level job stream data obtain in a product
environ by an event driven softwar probe is us to
drive a model of a multiprogram comput system the cpu
schedul algorithm of the model is systemat vari thi techniqu
call trace driven model provid an accur replica of a
product environ for the test of variat in the system
at the same time alter in schedul method can be
easili carri out in a control wai with caus and
effect relationship be isol the schedul method test includ the
best possibl and worst possibl method the tradit method of
multiprogram theori round robin first come first serv etc and
dynam predictor the rel and absolut perform of these schedul
method ar given it is conclud that a success cpu
schedul method must be preemptiv and must prevent a given
job from hold the cpu for too long a period
