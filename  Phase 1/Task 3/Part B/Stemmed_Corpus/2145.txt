autom of etch pattern layout help heurist etch pattern layout
program is an applic program develop to computer the tediou
and error prone although vital import wire design of print
circuit board help help autom a design stage on step
closer to product than logic design it can be us
to design wire pattern of two layer circuit board on
which ic in dual in line packag as well as
discret compon such as transistor and resistor have been place
help emploi two method of wire on is the heurist
method which simul human approach to wire design and the
other is the theoret interest but time consum method of
maze run base on the lee s algorithm help perform
more than 90 percent of requir wire by the heurist
path with respect to a perform function for each point
to point and point to line connect it can bring
the number of success wire connect veri close to 100
