scalar and planar valu curv fit us spline under tension
the spline under tension wa introduc by schweikert in an
attempt to imit cubic spline but avoid the spuriou critic
point thei induc the defin equat ar present here togeth
with an effici method for determin the necessari paramet and
comput the result spline the standard scalar valu curv fit
problem is discuss as well as the fit of open
and close curv in the plane the us of these
curv and the import of the tension in the fit
