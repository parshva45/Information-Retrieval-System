a note on linear program algorithm design a combinatori problem
as linear program model grow bigger and bigger in size
much actual data that must be memor is often put
on magnet tape or disk and consequ there is an
improportion fast rise in the consumpt of comput timeo cut
down thi expens an ever increas effort is made to
design more effici algorithm thi paper is meant to support
the effort it is attempt to find some characterist of
the wai a pivot column is found the number of
repetit of a certain transfer of data from tape to
core memori is consid after some simplif the problem is
restat in a gener wai the gener function of the
probabl distribut and the moment gener function of the number
of repetit is found asymptot formula ar given for the
moment us a result from a paper of s narumi
1 the result mai be appli to write veri effici
routin that search for an extrem valu in a tabl
formula provid a mean of calcul the comput time in
