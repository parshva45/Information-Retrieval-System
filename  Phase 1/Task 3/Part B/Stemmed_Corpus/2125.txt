a note on minim length polygon approxim to a digit
contour a method for extract a smooth polygon contour from
a digit imag is illustr the order sequenc of contour
point and the connect graph of the imag ar first
obtain by a modifi ledlei algorithm in on imag scan
a minim perimet polygon subject to specifi constraint is then
chosen as the approxim contour the determin of the minim
polygon can be reduc to a nonlinear program problem solv
by an algorithm which take into account the weak bond
