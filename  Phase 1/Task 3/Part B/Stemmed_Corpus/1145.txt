git a heurist program for test pair of direct line
graph for isomorph given a pair of direct line graph
the problem of ascertain whether or not thei ar isomorph
is on for which no effici algorithm solut is known
sinc a straightforward enum algorithm might requir 40 year of
run time on a veri high speed comput in order
to compar two 15 node graph a more sophist approach
seem call for the situat is similar to that prevail
in area such as game plai and theorem prove where
practic algorithm ar unknown for the interest case but where
variou practic though onli partial success techniqu ar avail git
graph isomorph tester incorpor a varieti of process that attempt
to narrow down the search for an isomorph or to
demonstr that none exist no on scheme is reli upon
exclus for a solut and the program is design to
avoid excess comput along fruitless line git ha been written
