an improv program synthes algorithm and it correct an improv
program synthes algorithm base on the algorithm propos by walding
and lee in 1969 is given in the old algorithm
the program synthes problem is translat into a theorem prove
problem and a program is obtain by analyz a proof
for the improv algorithm the analysi is not necessari and
a program is obtain as soon as the proof is
complet thi is achiev by us a modifi variabl trace
mechan invent by green in 1969 the correct of the
improv algorithm is also prove i e the program thu
