execut time requir for encipher program although encipher ha often
been discuss as a mean to protect comput data it
cost ar not well establish five experi were conduct to
measur the cpu time on a cdc 6400 requir by
addit cipher program both in assembl languag and in fortran
a null transform to measur the time to move data
without encipher encipher with on word kei encipher with a
125 word kei doubl kei encipher and encipher us a
pseudo random kei the result were analyz for consist over
100 run and the effect of constant and intermitt error
were consid time rate for assembl languag encipher rang from
498 800 charact per second for a pseudo random kei
cipher to 2 092 000 charact per second for a
constant on word kei cipher the latter is almost equival
to the rate requir simpli to move data without encipher
fortran test requir over four time as much cpu time
thi paper introduc the idea on enciph time coeffici the
ratio of enciph time to the time taken to fetch
and store data without encipher cacm august 1974 friedman t
