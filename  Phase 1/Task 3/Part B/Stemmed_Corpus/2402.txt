inform to frame structur hypothes which can computation be test
and refin by refer to the experiment data applic of
standard pattern recognit algorithm is hinder by the fact that
the cross correl between a model and the correct structur
cannot be comput becaus of a fundament incomplet in the
measur data howev it is possibl to comput an upper
bound to such a cross correl a simpl exampl demonstr
that thi inform can be the basi of a techniqu
