system us a raster scan output devic crt or hardcopi
maintain a displai file in the xy or random scan
format scan convert hardwar or softwar must be provid to
translat the pictur descript from the xy format to the
raster format publish scan convers algorithm which ar fast will
reserv a buffer area larg enough to accommod the entir
screen on the other hand those which us a small
buffer area ar slow becaus thei requir multipl pass through
the xy displai file the scan convers algorithm describ here
us a link list data structur to process the line
of the draw in strip correspond to group of scan
line a rel small primari memori buffer area is us
to accumul the binari imag for a group of scan
line when thi portion of the draw ha been plot
the buffer is reus for the next portion becaus of
the list process procedur us onli a singl pass through
the xy displai file is requir when gener the binari
imag and onli a slight increas in execut time over
the fulli buffer core result result slow that storag requir
can be reduc by more than 80 percent while caus
less than a 10 percent increas in execut time cacm
