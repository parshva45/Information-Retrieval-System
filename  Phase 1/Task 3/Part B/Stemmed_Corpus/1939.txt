comput program which allow the user to constrain and direct
the gener by the simpl but power devic of restrict
subtre the program is a direct random gener which accept
as input a subtre with restrict and produc around it
a tree which satisfi the restrict and is readi for
the next phase of the grammar the underli linguist model
is that at noam chomski as present in aspect of
